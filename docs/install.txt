Download the source distribution and extract it.

wget http://somewhere/django-support-page-0.1.tar.gz
tar xzvf django-support-page-0.1.tar.gz

Go into the resulting directory and install it

cd django-support-page-0.1.tar.gz
sudo python setup.py install

Add the following to settings.py:

The email address to send support requests to (not required if you
intend to disable to default mail handler, removing it is covered in configure.    txt).

DJANGO_SUPPORT_EMAIL_TO = ["nobody@test.com"]


The example project contains a shell script called dummymail.sh, which starts
a fake mail server on port 1025 and prints any emails received out. If you
would like to use it when testing with your own project, add the following settings.

EMAIL_HOST = 'localhost'
EMAIL_PORT = 1025


To run the dummy mail server:

./example/dummymail.sh

You will see the contents of any mail sent printed in the terminal where you
start the script.

django-support page supports Django static media support, to use it add 
a STATIC_URL to your settings.py file.

STATIC_URL = 'http://localhost:8000/static/'


If you do not intend to use Django's static media support, copy the templates in django_support_page to your own templates directory, and the contents of the static directory to the location you serve your static media from. django-support-page's default templates assume that you have a base template, and that it follows certain conventions, see templates.txt for details.

Add django_support_page to your INSTALLED_APPS setting.

INSTALLED_APPS = (
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.sites',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    'django_support_page',
    # Uncomment the next line to enable the admin:
    # 'django.contrib.admin',
    # Uncomment the next line to enable admin documentation:
    # 'django.contrib.admindocs',
)


Include django_support_pages urls in your urls.py.

from django.conf.urls.defaults import *

urlpatterns = patterns('',
    (r'^support/', include("django_support_page.urls")),
)


Finally start the Django application.

cd example
python manage.py runserver

Visit http://localhost:8000/support/ to see the default form and send a test message.
